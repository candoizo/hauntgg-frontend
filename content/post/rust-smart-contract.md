Rust has been an enjoyable language to learn thanks to it's wide selection of community crates. I've recently ventured into the hype and learning about Smart Contracts. I'll summarize how to get started in Rust!


I like podcasts because they're usually free with skippable ads, and I'm going to briefly review two I have been enjoying latetly (RIGHT AFTER I TELL YOU ABOUT SHADOW ZIP LEGENDS RECRUITER, jk). Maybe it will even be a thing, I think I go through enough to have contenders? If it helps someone spot a decent one I will get the warm fuzzies. I'll try to keep one regarding technology/security/law stuff, but the other is going to be wildcard with no fixed category! Now, without further ado...

## Intrepid

Intrepid has been my favourite podcast for a long time. It's definitly one of the most boring. This podcast is run by a duo, who more often than not will bring on a guest who is knowledgable on the topic.

Craig Tucker is a thingy at the University of Ottawa. He teaches with their Law Faculty. Stephanie is an ex-CSE analyst!

There have been some fun dicussions ranging from hypothetical Middle Earth wiretapping, and Craig always says something interesting about cyber.

## From John to Justin

My first real listening commitment to podcasts started in what I believe to be the most well known, "A History of Rome", narrated by Craig. That may have been my first suggestion, although it would have been sorely overplayed. Hence why I was delighted to find the John to Justin podcast. It retraces notable information about past Canadian Prime Ministers in a bite-sized format.

Episode: 1

These types of series work better in a chronological order.
