Running different operating systems is extremely useful when testing differnet security functions.

While not having a particular operating system is a convienient reason for not doing things you didn't already want to, it's pretty annoying when you actually have things you're interested in trying.

For my the case has often been:
- Cross compiling Software
- Testing results on different systems
- Trying OS exclusives

For future me when I want to do these things I am going to speedrun how to setup **every** single one in VirtualBox! Not through technical prowess but through the most practically maintained option available.

## Windows

This once seemed to be nearly the hardest until I was pointed towards the Microsoft Edge Developer Edition of Windows 10!

Pretty awesome for many reasons, and valid for 60 days.

Easymode, Microsoft prepackes testing versions for Web Developers™️ to test on Microsoft Internet Explorer / Edge for X amount of days. Renew as necessary.

## MacOS

Creating a MacOS requires a genuine copy of OSX downloaded from the App Store. Luckily the download is available for free. Once you find a copy, we'll use VirtualBox to load it up.

## Android

This one is especially uesful for app testing on a desktop.

This one feels pretty cool actually.

## iOS

Emulate it in Xcode, get Coreillium, buy the device, or tell me how!

## Linux

You obviously already were using Linux, but for posterity Kali and RedHat have some pretty out-the-box setups. Obviously bare hardware calls for the coolest ones.
